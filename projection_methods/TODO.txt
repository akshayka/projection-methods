- implement save_problem [Done]
- write plotting code [Done!]
- write shell scripts, run experiments, modify algorithms -- rinse and repeat!

- investigate: why is convergence so fast (1 iteration!) when we start with ones?
- cook up harder problems (convergence should not happen after one iteration!)
- implement SCS problem in problem_factory
- *** what is a correct way to measure residuals for all three algorithms? ***
----- the sum of the distances from the iterate to both the left and right sets
      feels very suboptimal. For example, if the two sets were hyperplanes that
      were almost parallel, then this sum could be very small even when the
      iterate were very far from the intersection of the two hyperplanes.
- *** why does apop_exact diverge after a certain number of iterations? ***
----- could it be numerical instability? for example, a halfspace is added that
      takes the iterates way out of the optimal set?
----- whatever is happening, it is still the case that every outer approximation
      problem is feasible
----- due to numerical instability, it is possible that an untrue statement
      (i.e., a hyperplane of the form { x | a.dot(x) == b } that is _not_
      a superset (nor a subset) of the affine set, or similarly a halfspace
      that is _not_ a superset (nor a subset) of the convex set; if this were
      to happen, then the outer projection would not necessarily bring the
      iterate closer to the optimal set (in particular, convergence guarantees
      would be lost)
----- it is also possible that my code / math for computing containing
      hyperplanes and halfspaces is not correct, or that my code for, e.g.,
      projecting onto an SOC is incorrect
