- line search
- multiple state variables

*** What's the deal with zero cones? can't we just do a presolve and get rid
    of variables that are known to be zero? ***
----- perhaps eliminating it breaks the avoidance of zero (ie, perhaps iterates
      may converge to zero, even if a non-zero solution exists, when the
      zero cones are eliminated).
----- double check with boyd that eliminating zero cones in outer projection is
      fine

completed tasks
- implement save_problem
- write plotting code
- implement projection onto affine set as a (factorized) sparse matrix solve
- cook up harder problems (convergence should not happen after one iteration!)

*** If a portion of x lies in the zero cone, can we add that constraint to
    for exaple our outer projections and still solve them efficiently?
----- sure; this just amounts to eliminating some variables, I think.
> my answer is yes; this is just an elimination

*** what is a correct way to measure residuals for all three algorithms? ***
----- the sum of the distances from the iterate to both the left and right sets
      feels very suboptimal. For example, if the two sets were hyperplanes that
      were almost parallel, then this sum could be very small even when the
      iterate were very far from the intersection of the two hyperplanes.
> [Done -- the distance from the two sets is fine]

*** why does apop_exact diverge after a certain number of iterations? ***
----- could it be numerical instability? for example, a halfspace is added that
      takes the iterates way out of the optimal set?
----- whatever is happening, it is still the case that every outer approximation
      problem is feasible
----- due to numerical instability, it is possible that an untrue statement
      (i.e., a hyperplane of the form { x | a.dot(x) == b } that is _not_
      a superset (nor a subset) of the affine set, or similarly a halfspace
      that is _not_ a superset (nor a subset) of the convex set; if this were
      to happen, then the outer projection would not necessarily bring the
      iterate closer to the optimal set (in particular, convergence guarantees
      would be lost)
----- it is also possible that my code / math for computing containing
      hyperplanes and halfspaces is not correct, or that my code for, e.g.,
      projecting onto an SOC is incorrect
----- it _may_ have been a pickling issue. the class definitions for many of
      the oracles and projectables changed after the object had been pickled.
      scrapping the old problem and generating a new one has "solved" the issue,
      insofar as apop (exact) generates a reasonable sequence of iterates
      when solving a similar problem (problem name 2550_rszs); however, the
      residuals are embarassingly high (> 0.1). it is not clear if the issue
      has been corrected, or if it has simply been hidden.
> [Done -- it was a pickling issue]
